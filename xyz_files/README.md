# This directory contains the xyz coordinates of all optimized structures used in the IGPS QM cluster modeling study executed by Heidi Klem at Colorado State University.

### Geometry optimizations were performed using Gaussian 16, Revision C.01. 
-  Calculation specifications: wb97xd/ 6-31+g(d) on S and O atoms, and 6-31g(d) on C, H and N atoms
-  Certain atomic coordinates were frozen during optimizations using the -1 optimization flag in the second column of the molecule specification

### Each xyz file contains the energy calculated using Gaussian 16, Revision C.01. 
- Calculation specifications: # b3lyp/6-311+G(2d,2p) scrf=(solvent=diethylether) EmpiricalDispersion=GD3BJ

### Structures are already aligned for easy visualization in user-preferred software
